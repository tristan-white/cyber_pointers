# List of random notes that will need to be organized later
- Noticed an issue where the rootfs didn't contain config files needed to emulate the router properly located in /var/run.
  - Not sure if this will work yet, but my thought is that if I start the router, and run something like `tar -czvf /tmp/archive.tar.gz www/ sbin/ etc/ dev/ bin/ ...` containing nearly every directory in the root directory aside from stuff like `sys/ proc/ tmp/ media/ mnt/ boot/ ...`. 
    - After this, do the `cat archive.tar.gz | ./exfil.mipsel` like you did for rootfs, but now for this fat tar file instead
    - After untarring this, I believe that you will get an error along the lines of `tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors`
      - This shouldn't cause an issue. When unzipping make sure to use the -v flag to see what the last file it untarred was. If that file matches the last file that was tarred on the router, then you should be ok. If you try to include some of the directories listed above, I believe you will get errors about EOL since they contain weird files in proc/ and /mtd/ and sys/
  - I think this will be better than simply the rootfs since it will now contain files that rootfs doesn't since it will get the files that are created on the boot.
  - Might have to create a proc, mtd, sys... directory (empty for each) since I am not grabbing those from the router itself
- Portforwarding error when running qemu
  - This one can be hella annoying, but the only solutions I found were to kill the process holding that port
    - To see what the PID is holding the port run `sudo lsof -i :<PORT>`
    - Then simply kill that PID and try again
