Not even close to totally flushed out, but a begining as to what does what

-machine
    * You can remove this, not sure what it defaults to

  -cpu
    * You can remove this as well, not sure what it defaults to

  -m 1G
    * You can remove this and it defaults to a value that works also. Just as long as it isn't too low

  -drive file=image.qcow2 
    * Crashes "ALERT! LABEL=rootfs does not exist. Dropping to a shell!"
    * I am unsure of the relation between root=LABEL=rootfs and file=image.qcow2

  -device
    * drive with bus=0, unit=0 (index=0) exists
    * I've seen this before. Unsure of what it means. I believe that with correct configuration you don't need it.

  -netdev/id/hostfwd
    * none of these are required for successful boot, however you'll lose ability to communicate with 
      host machine if not configured correctly. Will add to this later
  
  -kernel
    * you just simply need this no matter what it seems. Has to be a valid elf of the linux kernel
    
  -initrd
    * kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
    * I feel like it isn't needed under certain conditions, but not sure right now
  
  -nographic
    * removing this creates a new window that runs the emulation like before (just doesn't provide the booting information so
      it's hard to tell if there was an error or not
  
  -append
    * removing this completely caused the following "no root device specified, boot arguments must include root="
    * doing root=/dev/sda (which I've seen reccomended everywhere) caused this "kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: unable to mount 
      root fs on unknown-block(0,0)

# How to setup the ESSENTIALS
Github limits files to < 100MB, so I was forced to zip the 3 required files and the split them. To revert them to normal you must, combine the split files, then untar it

  - To tar
    - `tar -czvf archive.tar.gz image.qcow2 initfd.bin kernel.bin`
  - To untar
    - `tar -xzvf archive.tar.gz`
  - To split the tar
    - `split -b 50M archive.tar.gz archive.tar.gz.part-`
  - To recombine the split files
    - `cat archive.tar.gz.part-* > archive.tar.gz`
