# List of questions which... once I solve... can actually emulate stuff
I am simply trying to create a bzImage of the linux kernel. This is required by any emulator to run and for whatever reason I can't figure out so many things about it?

- What is a buildchain used for. I downloaded a buildchain from https://toolchains.bootlin.com/releases_mips32el.html?

- Can I simply download it from somewhere? I can't find any database.
    - Am I supposed to compile it myself?

- How do I compile the linux os to a single executable that I can use with qemu?
    - Do I run make within the directory and pull the elf from some folder?
        - Every attempt at that has led to compile failure (library issues or just other random stuff)  
    - Do I need a full toolchain for this to compile it to a different architecure (mipsel32 for example)?
        - Is this where buildroot comes into play? Every attempt at buildroot errored out before compiling so I couldn't get answers.
- What is the purpose of buildroot?
    - Does buildroot give the same end result as like something from the toolchains link above?
  
So far, every question I have, I am one step away from solving, but since nothing quite works I can't confirm or deny anything. Beat af, like chris brown on rhianna beat.
