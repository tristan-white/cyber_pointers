# List of questions which... once I solve... can actually emulate stuff
## I downloaded a buildchain from https://toolchains.bootlin.com/releases_mips32el.html. What am I supposed to do with this?
I am simply trying to create a bzImage of the linux kernel. This is required by any emulator to run and for whatever reason I can't figure out so many things about it?

## Can I simply download it from somewhere? I can't find any database.
### Am I supposed to compile it myself?

## How do I compile the linux os to a single executable that I can use with qemu?
- Do I run make within the directory and pull the elf from some folder?
- Do I need a full toolchain for this to compile it to a different architecure (mipsel32 for example)?
-- Is this where buildroot comes into play? Every attempt at buildroot errored out before compiling so I couldn't get answers.
  
So far, every question I have, I am one step away from solving, but since nothing quite works I can't confirm or deny anything. Beat af, like chris brown on rhianna beat.
