# List of questions which... once I solve... can actually emulate stuff
Overall, I want to emulate a device once I have it's firmware (rootfs).

- Is it required to have the uboot as well?
    - Is it not required, but just make it easier? Either way, how would I use it or something else if I don't have it?

One of the steps is to simply create a bzImage of the linux kernel (that closest matches the one of the target hardware??). This is required by any emulator to run and for whatever reason I can't figure out so many things about it?

- What is a buildchain used for. I downloaded a buildchain from https://toolchains.bootlin.com/releases_mips32el.html?

- Can I simply download it from somewhere? I can't find any database.
    - Am I supposed to compile it myself?

- How do I compile the linux os to a single executable that I can use with qemu?
    - Do I run make within the directory and pull the elf from some folder?
        - Every attempt at that has led to compile failure (library issues or just other random stuff)  
    - Do I need a full toolchain for this to compile it to a different architecure (mipsel32 for example)?
        - Is this where buildroot comes into play? Every attempt at buildroot errored out before compiling so I couldn't get answers.
- What is the purpose of buildroot?
    - (ANSWER) Buildroot is a tool that allows you to generate a complete Linux system (including the kernel, libraries, and applications) for a specific target platform. It is typically used in embedded systems development where the system needs to be tailored to the specific hardware and software requirements of the platform.
    - Does buildroot give the same end result as like something from the toolchains link above?
    - What are the most important settings to change after running `make menuconfig` in the root directory of the buildroot
        - A few of the obvious are; allowing gdb, changing to libc/uclibc/or other, set optimization to 0 (makes debugging easier), set correct architecture, try to get closest matching version.
   
- I have the rootfs that I got from the hardware.
    - How can I turn it into a file that qemu can use?
        - Is this where `qemu-img convert` comes into play
    - Is there any reason I would first extract it, to then convert to a different file (qcow2 or raw are the 2 prefered for qemu)

- Do I include the rootfs when running the initial `qemu` command or do I first get it running, then send it to the now running enviornment
    - Should I setup a bridged interface?
         ```
         ip link add name br0 type bridge
         ip link set dev br0 up
         
- Is it possible to have a template qemu_run.sh script where all I have to do is simply change out the zImage (executable of the kernel/os), rootfs and maybe networking?
    - Why does attempting to use portforwarding `-net portforward=2222~:22-` 
         ip link set dev enp0s17 up
         ip link set dev enp0s17 master br0
         ```
    - Or use a tap?
        - What is tap?
        - No matter what I try, (either using  `ifconfig... tap1 up` or some other command) I can't change the tap1 interface status from down to up. WHY? 

- What are each of the following args for when running qemu
    - -hda <rootfs.img> 
        - why hda as opposed to hdb or some other? The manual with qemu shows other options, but doesn't explain what any of them are.
    - -append "root=/dev/sda console=ttyS0"
        - what does root= do?
        - why are some tutorials showing to use sda vs sda1 vs sda or when some use hda or some other thing
        - Should I use ttyS0, ive also seen a lot of other options with no explanations.
  
So far, every question I have, I am one step away from solving, but since nothing quite works I can't confirm or deny anything. Beat af, like chris brown on rhianna beat.
