  -

  -device
    * drive with bus=0, unit=0 (index=0) exists
    * I've seen this before. Unsure of what it means. I believe that with correct configuration you don't need it.

  -netdev/id/hostfwd
    * none of these are required for successful boot, however you'll lose ability to communicate with 
      host machine if not configured correctly. Will add to this later
  
  -kernel
    * you just simply need this no matter what it seems. Has to be a valid elf of the linux kernel
    
  -initrd
    * kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
    * I feel like it isn't needed under certain conditions, but not sure right now
  
  -nographic
    * removing this creates a new window that runs the emulation like before (just doesn't provide the booting information so
      it's hard to tell if there was an error or not
  
  -append
    * removing this completely caused the following "no root device specified, boot arguments must include root="
    * doing root=/dev/sda (which I've seen reccomended everywhere) caused this "kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: unable to mount 
      root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
